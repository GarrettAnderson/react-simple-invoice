# React Simple Invoice

An example of an Invoice component built with React that enables users to create invoices.

Totals are updated automatically as the user types values into the form fields.

Features:

* Drag-and-drop reordering of invoice line items implemented with `react-beautiful-dnd`
* SCSS Modules and CSS grid for style/layout.
* SVG UI icons from `react-icons` (docs: <https://react-icons.netlify.com/#/icons/md>)

The project code relates to posts on my blog at <https://firxworx.com>.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) v2.
